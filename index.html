                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Angello Parody, and I am a Mechatronics Engineer who graduated from SRH Hochschule Berlin. I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree in AI Engineering of Autonomous Systems at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI), where I am focusing on the integration of artificial intelligence and robotics to develop intelligent, adaptive, and autonomous technologies.</p>
                <p>Originally from Colombia, I’ve had the opportunity to live in several countries, including Guyana, Mongolia, and now Germany. Growing up in different cultural environments taught me adaptability, open-mindedness, and the value of connecting with people from diverse backgrounds. These experiences have shaped not only my global perspective but also my approach to teamwork and innovation.</p>
                <p>I’m passionate about sports, music, and helping others—values that keep me grounded and motivated to contribute positively to society. I strongly believe that technology should serve humanity, and my goal is to work in a leading tech company where I can use my skills in robotics and AI to make a meaningful impact on the world.</p>
                <p>Driven by curiosity and creativity, I aspire to bridge the gap between engineering and intelligent systems, developing technologies that improve everyday life and push the boundaries of what autonomous systems can achieve.</p>
